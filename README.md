# 📂 CSV File Chunker

This Python script reads a large CSV file and splits it into smaller chunks. Each chunk retains the header from the original CSV file. 📈➡️📉

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
- **Pandas**: Install the Pandas library using pip:

    ```
    pip install pandas
    ```

### 📥 Installing

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ufumzy/CSV-File-Chunker.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```
    cd CSV-File-Chunker
    ```

### ▶️ Usage

Run the script `test.py` with the path to your large CSV file as an argument. Ensure you set the correct file path for your large CSV.

```
python test.py /path/to/your/large.csv
```

### 🔍 Example

If your large CSV file is located at `/data/largefile.csv`, run the script like this:

```
python test.py /data/largefile.csv
```

This will create smaller chunk files in the same directory, each retaining the header from the original CSV file.
